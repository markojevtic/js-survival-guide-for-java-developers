###### Arrays and loops 

* iterate through indexes/property names:
```javascript
for (const name in array) {
    console.log("name: "+ name);
}
``` 
* iterate through indexes/property names:
```javascript
for (const value of array) { //Supported from ES6
    console.log("name: "+ value);
}
``` 

* How to overcome this issues?
    * use array methods, map, forEach, etc..( similar to Java Stream API)
