###### undefined vs null
* undefined - if object is not defined
    * it's more natural in JS, simply if you 
    * checking is "ugly" ( ```typeof prop 'undefined'```  but from ES5 ```prop === undefined``` 
* null - it's defined, but point to null :)
    * checking was/is more clear
    * produce a lot of defects 
    
Conclusion: always use undefined.
